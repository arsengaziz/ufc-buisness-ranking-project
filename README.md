**#UFC Business Value Ranking System**
**#Data Science for Strategic Fighter Investment**

**About the Project:**

This project ranks UFC fighters not just by athletic performance but by their business value.
In today’s fight game, value isn’t only about wins — it’s about hype, social influence, marketability, and the ability to generate ROI for the organization.
The goal is to support matchmaking, promotion strategy, and fighter investment decisions using data.

**Objectives:**

Quantify the business potential of UFC fighters, even beyond the top 15
Identify underrated fighters who could generate high returns
Support marketing & matchmaking decisions through data
Build a scalable model for use in sports analytics and talent management

**Features & Metrics:**

The model uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative data:
Fight purse
Instagram followers & activity
Bonus awards (FOTN, POTN, etc.)
PPV participation
Fight frequency & inactivity periods
Cancelled/postponed bouts
Media mentions / hype score
Championship potential (expert-assessed)

**Tech Stack:**

Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
Jupyter Notebook
Google Sheets / Excel (manual markup)
(Upcoming) ML models for value prediction and trend detection

**Visualizations (Planned):**

Bar Plot - Top 10 fighters by business value
Scatter Plot - Followers vs Fight Frequency vs Purse (with Hype color scale)
Heatmap - Correlation between all metrics
Boxplot - Purse distribution by fighter rank
Timeline - Fighter activity/inactivity periods

**Disclaimer**

This project is fan-made and not affiliated with UFC.
Data is partially collected manually or estimated for educational purposes.
This project was started **before major shifts in the UFC landscape** -  
when **Islam Makhachev was still reigning in lightweight**, and **Ilia Topuria hadn't yet taken over the division**.

That context matters because the data reflects the roster and hype dynamics of that period — showing how fast business value can change, even when rankings lag behind.
